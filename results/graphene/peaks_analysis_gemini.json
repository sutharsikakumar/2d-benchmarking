The observed FWHM of 32.54 cm\u207b\u00b9 suggests a certain degree of disorder or defects within the graphitic structure."

However, the given peak position is closer to the G band, making it less likely to be a pure D band.  It's possible there's a strong G band overlapping a weaker D band, but more data (e.g., a full spectrum) would be needed to confirm this."

While less likely than the 2D band of graphene, the observed peak at 2670.19 cm-1 could potentially arise from a significantly shifted nitrile stretch, especially if the sample context suggests the presence of nitrile-containing compounds."

While 2670.19 cm-1 is significantly lower than this typical range, overtones or combination bands involving C-H stretches could potentially appear at lower wavenumbers. However, these are typically much weaker than the fundamental vibrations, making this assignment less probable given the observed high intensity."
