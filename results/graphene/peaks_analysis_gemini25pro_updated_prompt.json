This assignment is based on its specific frequency, which is a hallmark of graphitic materials like graphene and graphite. The significant peak broadening (FWHM \u2248 32.5 cm\u207b\u00b9) is a key diagnostic feature indicating the presence of structural disorder or nanocrystallinity, making materials like reduced graphene oxide (rGO) or nanocrystalline graphite highly probable sources.",

The seminal work by Ferrari & Robertson (2000) provides a framework for interpreting Raman spectra of carbon materials, definitively assigning the ~1580 cm\u207b\u00b9 peak to the E\u2082g mode and linking its FWHM to disorder. Furthermore, spectroscopic databases like RRUFF (e.g., Graphite R040012) consistently show this peak as the primary feature of graphite.",
        "alternative_considerations": "Alternative assignments include C=C stretching modes in other highly conjugated systems. Porphyrins, found in heme, have a strong \u03bd\u2082 mode near this frequency, as documented by Wood et al. (2001). Conjugated polymers like PPV also show a phenyl ring stretch in this region. However, these assignments were ranked lower because the G-band of carbon is one of the most universally recognized and intense peaks in Raman spectroscopy, making it the most parsimonious and probable assignment in the absence of further spectral context."

This is a second-order Raman feature, not a fundamental vibration. The combination of its peak position, strong intensity, and Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of approximately 50 cm\u207b\u00b9 provides a robust fingerprint for few-layer graphene, most likely bilayer graphene.",

(2006) demonstrated that the shape and FWHM of the 2D band are powerful, non-destructive tools for determining the number of layers in a graphene sample. The observed peak profile, a single symmetric Lorentzian/Gaussian with a FWHM of ~50 cm\u207b\u00b9, aligns perfectly with the established spectral signature for bilayer graphene, distinguishing it from the sharper peak of monolayer graphene and the split peak of bulk graphite.",
        "alternative_considerations": "Graphite was considered a secondary possibility. However, its 2D band is typically found at a higher frequency (~2720 cm\u207b\u00b9) and is clearly split into two components (2D1 and 2D2), which is inconsistent with the observed single peak. Carbon nanotubes also exhibit a G' band in this region, but this assignment is less likely without other characteristic CNT peaks (like the RBM) and because the observed peak shape is so archetypal of 2D few-layer graphene."
