mathematical analysis + lorentz transformation on raman spectra using gemini 

what would a typical query for a material science application look like?
Queries, "based on this raman spectra, is it a good sample or not?"
"What are characteristics of this raman spectra?"

1. peak positition
2. peak intensity
3. peak width (fwhm)
4. line shape
5. background signal
6. shifts
7. number of peaks
8. relative intensities



i want to input a raman spectra... just numbers, then it normalizes?
molecule elucidation - deduce the molecular structure based on experimentally obtained data
