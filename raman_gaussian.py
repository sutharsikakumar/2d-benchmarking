"""Apply Gaussian filter to identify peaks + Width at Half Maximum (WHM) in Raman spectra.
Create a png image with Gaussian smoothed spectra, Gaussian overlayed on raw spectra and SG-filter data.
Identify the peaks in the Gaussian smoothed spectra and calculate, return another json file
with peak positions, intensities, and WHM values."""
